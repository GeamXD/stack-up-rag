        "What is Learn & Earn\u2019s Reward Mechanism?  Since Learn & Earn started, we have always rewarded players on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that the fastest players to submit a quest receive rewards. In response to user feedback highlighting the challenge of earning rewards and the pressure to quickly complete quests, Learn & Earn is trying out a new reward distribution system. This change is intended to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to earn rewards for their effort and hard work, even if they may not be able to participate right away when a quest launches. We want to continue rewarding our very dedicated players who are there at 1200 hrs GMT+8 to start questing, so a portion of the rewards will be reserved for the fastest players. The remaining rewards will be distributed via the new mechanism. For all quests included in this experimental reward mechanism, it will be stated explicitly in the quests\u2019 introduction.  How it works?  Example 1: Random Allocation Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, and 2000 players submit their entries. 1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. The remaining 500 rewards are randomly distributed among the 1000 approved players who weren't the fastest to submit. Each of these remaining players has a 50% chance of receiving a reward. Example 2: Even Distribution Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, totalling a prize pool of $1500. 2000 players have submitted their entries.1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. After distributing $1000 to the fastest players, $500 remains in the prize pool. This remaining amount is then evenly divided among the remaining 1000 approved players who have not received a reward yet. Consequently, each of these players will receive 50 cents. FAQs 1. How will I know if I am one of the fastest players to receive a reward?Your quest status will be \u2018rewarded\u2019 and you can also view your reward in your list of transactions on the \"Balance & Request History\" page found under \"My Balance\". 2. How is the random allocation conducted?We will use a seed for a random number generator (RNG). The RNG will then generate a list of numbers which will correspond to a player\u2019s submission number. 3. How will I know if I have been rewarded in the random allocation mechanism?As this mechanism is still in the experimental stage, users who are rewarded via the new mechanism will see the approved status. However, you can view transactions on the \"Balance & Request History\" page found under \"My Balance\". If you are rewarded, you will see your reward for the quest as a transaction.  4. How can I provide feedback on the new reward mechanism? You can visit our Discord server and head to the [ideas-and-feedback channel] channel to share your thoughts.Disclaimer: This initiative is currently in the experimental phase, with potential changes to how it works. It will undergo limited testing for a while and its future implementation is still uncertain. Any updates will be communicated clearly. ",

Abuse Reporting: Users are encouraged to report any form of platform abuse, including cheating, harassment, or violations of this policy through privately messaging our Community Moderators or using the General Enquiry form. Your reports play a vital role in maintaining a safe and respectful community. All abuse reports will be treated with utmost confidentiality, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you can use our platform without fear of retaliation or exposure when reporting abusive behaviour.   Appeal: Our quests are intentionally designed to make it difficult for users who complete the content on their own to submit work that is similar enough to be suspected of being a copied submission. A manual review is also conducted by our team for users who have been flagged for suspicious activity to ensure accuracy. However, users who believe that they have been mistakenly flagged for cheating can submit an appeal through our StackUp Help Centre Submission-Related-Matters Form. Appeals will be carefully re-reviewed by our team; however, please note that we cannot guarantee that a second review is done for every case and reserve the right to uphold our decision based on the evidence available.  ",
        "We strongly advise against joining the new StackUp Learn & Earn as the suspension on the old StackUp platform also extends to the new platform. While you can participate in quests, earn rewards, and perhaps be able to submit a withdrawal request on the new platform, there's a high risk of cancellation or failure, and StackUp will not be held responsible for any accumulated reward amounts affected by observed suspension records from the old platform.",
        "Stackies flagged for suspicious activity will receive email notifications and submission reason codes based on the type of cheating involved. Expect an email within 1-5 working days regarding actions taken on your account. Below are two scenarios you might encounter when flagged, along with their implications and suggested actions. Scenario 1: Your quest submission has been flagged for suspicious activity, and you have received a warning email. However, your account has not been suspended. StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback: \"Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. Please see the Guide for more info.\" Email Notifications \u201cRegarding Your Recent Submission (Warning)\u201d If you receive this email, your account is not suspended. This indicates that the warning pertains only to a specific quest and will not affect your future quest submissions. However, your account will be closely monitored and may be suspended if the team observes or identifies other suspicious indicators.   Scenario 2: Your quest submission has been rejected because your account is suspended and is currently under investigation. StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback: \u201cYour account is currently under investigation for suspension. We will not be considering your deliverable.\u201d Email Notifications \u201c\ud83e\udd14 Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Bank Details Detected\u201d \u201c\ud83e\udd14 Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Wallet Details Detected\u201d \u201cAccount Suspension Notification\u201d Your account may be suspended due to a violation of our policy, and the specific reason may constitute the below:      2.1 Your account has been temporarily suspended due to duplicated withdrawal details detected. As sharing withdrawal details constitutes cheating under our policy, your account may be temporarily suspended and withdrawal features will be restricted until this is resolved. Stackies should follow the email notification for instructions on updating their withdrawal details and having their features resumed. If our investigation determines that your account can be lifted from the temporary suspension, please note that any past submissions submitted during the suspension will not be reviewed again. However, rest assured that future submissions will not be affected unless another suspicious activity is observed.       2.2 Your account has been suspended due to flagged suspicious activity. Our policy follows a zero-tolerance approach towards Stackies who engage in cheating and/or exploitative measures to gain an unfair advantage towards the prize pool money. Stackies who are found to have breached StackUp's policy multiple times will have their account suspended, rewards revoked, withdrawals restricted, and you will no longer have access to your Learn & Earn account. Suspended users will also not be allowed to create a new account on our platform.",
        "To ensure a seamless learn-and-earn experience on the platform and avoid being flagged for cheating, below are some guidelines recommended for Stackies to follow:  Attempt the quest on your own. Never send your screenshot or your code to someone else. Delete your screenshots immediately if you are sharing a workstation. Do not copy sections of code wholesale from internet resources, but instead edit and refine your code as necessary. Discussion within the community is encouraged when faced with difficulties. However, do not ask for direct yes/no or correct/incorrect answers on the help channels. Do not share same withdrawal details. Having multiple accounts on the platform is not allowed ",
        "We understand that Stackies may want some visibility as to why they have been suspended or flagged, however our internal processes and data privacy considerations prohibit us from sharing specific evidence or details related to individual cases. Please understand that this measure is in place to protect not only the privacy of the users involved but also the integrity of our detection methods. While we are unable to provide details that would include other user\u2019s personal data, submissions or other sensitive processes, we will still outline the steps that we took as due diligence so you are aware of the steps that have been taken. Our decisions are not taken lightly and are based on a careful review of available information, a commitment to maintaining fairness for all users, and a strong commitment to user privacy. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to strive for a positive and secure platform experience for all users.",
        "StackUp employs various advanced detection software, as well as AI and machine learning models, to identify suspicious user behaviour, submissions, and other activities on our platform. These automated systems alert us to certain high-risk signals and indicators for investigation, which are then complemented by human intervention for a thorough review to ensure that our checks are comprehensive and multi-layered. Below briefly outlines the steps that we use to detect on cheating users and submission, which includes but not limited to:  Identification of highly suspicious activity (submissions and user behaviours) through system detection against various resources, users' platform behaviour, and account history. Manual human intervention for further investigation and review of flagged users and/or activity before concluding that suspicious activity has taken place. ",
        "StackUp's commitment to fairness is backed by a robust cheating detection system. This involves advanced analytics with human intervention and reviews to ensure that our developers have a maintained fair environment where efforts are recognised and rewarded fairly. If a submission is initially approved or rewarded but is later found to be unfairly graded, StackUp takes action by clawing back the rewards gained unfairly. This is essential to maintain the integrity of our platform. Please read our Platform Integrity Policy to gain a better understanding.",
        "To ensure StackUp complies with all applicable laws and regulations, we are updating the list of countries supported by our platform, effective from November 9, 2022. Unfortunately, we will no longer be able to support Stackies residing in or citizens of the following regions/countries:  Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea) Republic of Sudan Russia Islamic Republic of Iran Republic of Cuba Ukraine Syrian Arab Republic State of Libya Federal Republic of Somalia Republic of Yemen Democratic Republic of the Congo  Why are these countries not supported? StackUp, along with our campaign partners and payment providers, must adhere to legal obligations. Upon review, we have determined that supporting Stackies from these countries is restricted by applicable laws. This includes challenges in awarding quest rewards and processing payments through our payment providers. Despite our best efforts, we regret that we are unable to facilitate rewards for Stackies in these countries. Additionally, due to system limitations and complexities, residents of the following countries may also face challenges joining our platform:  Afghanistan Pakistan Palestinian Territory Iraq  We appreciate your understanding as we work to uphold legal compliance while striving to support as many Stackies as possible.        ",
        "Users from these countries, whether residing in the region or citizens of it, will not be able to perform certain actions, including but not limited to submitting quests, earning monetary rewards, and making withdrawal requests.

        "From late December 2023 to the end of January 2024, we offered a balance transfer feature in the old StackUp platform for users with an account balance below $10 while encouraging those with balances exceeding $10 to withdraw their funds from the old platform.
